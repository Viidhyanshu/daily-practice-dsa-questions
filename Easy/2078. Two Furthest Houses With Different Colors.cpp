There are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors of length n, where colors[i] represents the color of the ith house.

Return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.

The distance between the ith and jth houses is abs(i - j), where abs(x) is the absolute value of x.


//solution
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& colors) {
        int n = colors.size();
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (colors[i] != colors[j]) {
                    result = max(result, j - i);
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
